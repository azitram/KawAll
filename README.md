**What is KawAll?**

"KawAll" (pronounced: kaÂ·wal) is an online-based application designed to safeguard its users from the side effects and likelihood of sexual crimes.
It achieves this by implementing preventive and protective measures, as well as providing recovery support, all within a flexible yet user-friendly and accessible application.

**Features Available**

1. Fake Call
Fake call is a modified voice recording designed to sound like a real phone conversation.
This is done to make suspicious individuals around the user aware that the user is "interacting" with someone else.
As a result, a fake call can deter potential predators by making them fear being caught, while also providing a sense of security to the user.

2. Rawan, Kawan! (Beware, Friends!)
Mentimeter word clouds display user opinions about areas known for being prone to sexual crimes.
These word clouds are created so that users can assess the areas they plan to visit and identify which locations are best avoided.

3. Counseling with professional psychologists or volunteer counselors

4. Ask The Doctor
A safe and reliable platform for addressing health concerns through a simple chat interface.

5. Cari Tahu, Yuk! (Let's Find Out)
Engaging courses on self-defense, facts and myths about sexual harassment, and ways to support victims.

6. Promos, Order History, Rate Your Experience

**About Our Mascot**
Our mascot is a hedgehog named Cupin. The hedgehog symbolizes protection and comfort.
